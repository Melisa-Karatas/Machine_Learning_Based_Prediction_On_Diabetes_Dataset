# Machine_Learning_Based_Prediction_On_Diabetes_Dataset
This projects aims to develope a diabetese prediction model using machine learning when fundamental values are given.
_________
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and KidneyDiseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placedon the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are femalesat least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
